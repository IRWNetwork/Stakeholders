# Stakeholders
Introduction for Stakeholders and Legal Team
Hey guys this is Mark. This is where the IRW code will live. Github basically allows us to keep track of what we're doing, have an audit trail for who makes what changes / who pulled code etc. Right now I am the owner but would like to transfer that title to you (Scott or Eric). Please go to the billing section and enter a card to make the repository private, and I'll put all the files up so you can pull, look through it or whatever you like.
